✨ Hi, I'm Jackeline

🔍 **About me**

I am a **Data Scientist working at the intersection of AI/ML, model governance, and quantitative risk** in **regulated financial environments**.

I am an undergraduate student in **Applied and Computational Mathematics** at the **University of São Paulo (USP)**, with a strong foundation in **mathematics, statistics and computational methods**.

🔬 Focus Areas

- **Model Governance & Model Risk Management**
  - Methodological frameworks for statistical models, ML models (supervised & unsupervised), and Generative AI
  - Validation criteria, technical metrics, and lifecycle governance

- **Machine Learning & MLOps**
  - End-to-end ML pipelines with reproducibility, monitoring, and compliance
  - Integration of ML models into governed and scalable systems

- **Quantitative Risk**
  - Risk metrics and methodologies (VaR, CVaR, stress testing)
  - Model validation and regulatory alignment

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming**: Python, PySpark, R, MATLAB, C, C++
- **ML / AI**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Quant & Statistics**: NumPy, SciPy, pandas, statsmodels
- **MLOps / Data Engineering**: Git, Docker, Apache Airflow
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Databases**: SQL
